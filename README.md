# Projeto Final da capacitação - Programa Jovens Talentos da eLife Brasil
Este projeto tem como o intuito verificar o aprendizado dos discentes da segunda turma do Programa Jovens Talentos da eLife Brasil. Que deve seguir as seguintes caracteristicas:
<p>
    <li>Criar duas paginas em React.js: Uma para Configurar um ChatBot e outra para conversar com o Bot.</li>
    <li>Implementar um gerador de Chatbot que use a API da OpenAi para gerar as respostas do Chatbot e utilizar o MongoDB para armazenar as configurações do Chatbot.</li>
    <li>Desenvolver uma apresentação em forma de video, demostrando o funcionamento do projeto e comentando suas principais dificuldades. Video esse disponivel clicando aqui.</li>
</p>

## Para iniciar o projeto:

### `npm install`

Para Realizar a instalação de todas as dependências do react no projeto.
Deve ser realizado este processo na pasta principal do projeto (projeto-chatbot) e nos subprojetos, são eles (backend-mongoDB\projeto-chatbot-mongoDB) e (backend-openai-chat\projeto-chatbot-openai) 

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
